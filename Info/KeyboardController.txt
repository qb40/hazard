 E7h	GoldStar set turbo LED color to yellow (turbo off)
 E8h	GoldStar set turbo LED color to green (turbo on)
 EAh	GoldStar set turbo LED color to green (turbo on)
 EDh	double	this is a two part command to control the state of the
		  NumLock, CpasLock and ScrollLock LEDs
		The second byte contains the state to set LEDs.
		    bit 7-3	reserved. should be set to 0.
		    bit 2 = 0	Caps Lock LED off
		    bit 1 = 0	Num Lock LED off
		    bit 0 = 0	Scroll Lock LED off

 F0-FF	sngl	pulse output port low for 6 microseconds.
		bits 0-3 contain the mask for the bits to be pulsed.  A bit is
		  pulsed if its mask bit is zero
		bit0=system reset. Don't set to zero. Pulse only!
Note:	 keyboard controllers are widely different from each other.  You
	   cannot generally exchange them between different machines.

(Table P0402)
Values for Chips&Technologies extension commands:
 00h	return ID - returns A6h for a C&T controller, part # N93N8042/A
 02h	write input port
	next data byte to PORT 0060h is written to the controller's input port

Warning: the system must be designed to support output devices
		  connected to the input port to avoid potential damage
 04h	select turbo switch input
	next byte selects input:
	    bit 7: switch polarity
		(=0 input low = high speed, =1 input low = low speed)
	    bits 6-0: one bit set selects corresponding bit in Port1 as turbo
 05h	select turbo LED output
	next byte selects output:
	    bit 7: LED polarity	(=0 output low=LED on, =1 output low=LED off)
	    bit 6: LED port (=0 Port1, =1 Port2)
	    bits 5-0: one bit set selects corresponding bit in Port1/Port2 as
		LED output
Note:	these commands and any arguments are sent to PORT 0060h after writing

  command A1h to PORT 0064h

Bitfields for Compaq keyboard command byte:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table P0403)
 7	reserved
 6	=1 convert KB codes to 8086 scan codes
 5	=0 use 11-bit codes, 1=use 8086 codes
 4	=0 enable keyboard, 1=disable keyboard
 3	ignore security lock state
 2	this bit goes into bit2 status reg.
 1	reserved (0)
 0	generate interrupt (IRQ1) when output buffer full

Bitfields for keyboard command byte (alternate description):
Bit(s)	Description	(Table P0404)
 7	reserved (0)
 6	IBM PC compatibility mode
 5	IBM PC mode
	no parity, no stop bits, no translation
	(PS/2) force mouse clock low
 4	disable keyboard (clock)
 3	(AT) inhibit override -- ignore keyboard lock switch

(PS/2) reserved
 2	system flag
 1	(AT) reserved (0)
	(PS/2) enable mouse output buffer full interrupt (IRQ12)
 0	enable output buffer full interrupt (IRQ1)

Bitfields for keyboard controller output port:
Bit(s)	Description	(Table P0405)
 7	keyboard data (output)
 6	keyboard clock (output)
 5	(AT) =0 input buffer empty
	(MCA) outptu buffer full with mouse byte (connected to IRQ12)
 4	output buffer full with keyboard byte (connected to IRQ1)
 3	(MCA) mouse data (output)
 2	(MCA) mouse clock (output)
	used by Intel 386sx Chipset with AMI/Phoenix BIOSes for BIOS-specific
	  configuration of turbo switch
 1	gate address A20
 0	system reset
Note:	bit 0 (system reset) should always be set when writing the output

  port, as the system may hang constantly; use pulse output port
	  (command FEh) instead.

 04h	keyboard data line stuck high
 05h	(Compaq only) diagnostic feature

 13h	security on
	nonzero if password enabled
 14h	security off
	nonzero if password matched
 16h	password discard scancode 1
